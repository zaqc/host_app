Lookup Color Table
	Color1 - Maximum value of tracks channels (each channel has own color for draw from LUC table [256x256])
	Color2 - Value of channel that has value less or equal of channel with Color1
	Index - Index of channel that has is maximum value(index of LUCT)
	
each element of data (get it by GetData() function) linked with output screen array
is two case (various of vertical zoom)
1. one element of data appropriate of one or more point of screen array
2. in one point of screen appropriate of one or more element of data
	
for each iteration of data array
1. Take data value (Value)
2. Compare it with ScreenOut item
3. If Value greate then Color1 then Color2 <= Color1; Color1 <= Value; Index <= Index Of Value

for output data to screen
1. Take value from LUCT[Index] [Color1 + Color2 << 8]
2. Draw to screen

Show surface on screen
Surface One + Surface Two
size like a screen

  +------+ <- Visible part
  v      v
+-----++-----+
|     ||     |

         ^
         | <- Current position for draw data

when current drawing position arrive a right margin of second buffer
the buffers are swap vice versa around
first buffer contains picture for full screen
second buffer is empty and ready for draw
